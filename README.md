# Holidays at DLR 2022 ARR

# Introduction

This repository displays an after-action report that is like what I created in my day job as a Reporting Associate for The Disneyland Resort. <b>The data set used for this repository is public data of Yelp’s reviews for the holiday season at The Disneyland Resort. The reason is I’m not able to use the actual excel file due to its sensitive nature.</b> The Yelp’s reviews data set were like Disney’s own data sets.

# Abstract

Each year a new planning committee is selected for reoccurring and new special events. After-action reports give planning committees an overall snapshot of the trends for the special event. When it comes to a new special event, a mini after-action report would be created after two nights of a multi-night special event. For reoccurring special events, a standard after-action report is created after the last night of the special event. Holidays at The Disneyland Resort is a reoccurring special event, and it was created after the last night of the holiday season.

This is a preview of a slide of an After Action Report deck for Holidays at Disneyland Resort 2022.


# Summary of skills

This after-action report has been made with Microsoft Excel for the creation of charts. Microsoft Word was used to incorporate the charts and text for a detailed report. Microsoft PowerPoint was used for creating a presentation deck for our department managers.

# Findings

For this report, the trends show positive reviews for holiday decorations at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. There is a trend of positive interactions with Cast Members. There were trends of negative reviews for shows, parades, and fireworks cancelled due to weather. Another trend was for rides breaking down at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure during the holiday season.

# Challenges

The challenge for this after-action report was to find a public data set that would have trends that would be like Disney’s proprietary data set. Creating a streamlined version of the report for a presentation deck.

# Conclusion

This after-action report is made with the purpose of informing the planning committee of the trends regarding the special event. The planning committee will use the report to implement new offerings or discontinue unsuccessful ones for next year’s special event.
